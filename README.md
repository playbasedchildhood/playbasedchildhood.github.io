The Play-Based Childhood Initiative
-----------------------------------

The Play-Based Childhood initiative advocates for a childhood free from unnecessary digital exposure. It supports parents in setting boundaries around screen time to ensure a healthier developmental path for their children.

### Our core principles include:

1.  No smartphones for children under a certain age: Young children do not receive a smartphone, reducing unnecessary digital exposure.
2.  Limited and monitored screen time: Television, video games, and other digital media should be restricted and closely supervised by parents.
3.  Promotion of traditional play-based activities: Children should engage in outdoor play, sports, reading, and other real-world experiences to enhance their physical and cognitive skills.
4.  No social media for young children and adolescents: Even when children are introduced to smartphones at an appropriate age, social media access remains restricted due to its known [negative effects on mental and physical health](https://playbasedchildhood.github.io/blog/the-why-behind-this-inititative/).
5.  Encouragement of parental involvement: Parents play a crucial role in guiding children toward healthy habits, ensuring that screen time does not replace valuable family and social interactions.

Contract on Non-Use of a Smartphone
-----------------------------------

We invite parents and guardians to join us in our mission. As part of the initiative, we have established the Contract on Non-Use of a Smartphone, which serves as a commitment to delaying smartphone use among children and promoting healthier childhood experiences.

By signing this contract, you pledge to:

*   Delay giving a smartphone to your child until an appropriate age.
*   Actively monitor and limit screen exposure in your household.

This is not just a personal choice but a movement towards safeguarding the well-being of future generations. By joining this initiative, you will become part of a growing community of parents and caregivers dedicated to fostering a healthier, screen-free childhood.
